Program to find non coding RNAs (Chris and Ivans project)

This is a pipeline to identify long non coding RNAs from plant transcriptomes. It uses CNCI are it's core algorithm to
define non coding RNAs. It has additional filters to remove tRNAs, rRNAs, and precursor miRNAs, using a series of
databases and further filters.
